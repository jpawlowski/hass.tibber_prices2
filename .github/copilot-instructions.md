# Copilot Instructions

This repository contains a **custom component for Home Assistant**, intended to be distributed via the **HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)**.

## Development Guidelines

-   Follow the **official Home Assistant development guidelines** at [developers.home-assistant.io](https://developers.home-assistant.io).
-   Ensure compatibility with the **latest Home Assistant release**.
-   Use **async functions**, **non-blocking I/O**, and **config flows** where applicable.
-   Structure the component using these standard files:

    -   `__init__.py` – setup and teardown
    -   `manifest.json` – metadata and dependencies
    -   `config_flow.py` – if the integration supports UI configuration
    -   `sensor.py`, `switch.py`, etc. – for platforms
    -   `const.py` – constants (`DOMAIN`, `CONF_*`, etc.)

-   Use Home Assistant's built-in helpers and utility modules:

    -   `homeassistant.helpers.entity`, `device_registry`, `config_validation`
    -   `homeassistant.util.dt` (`dt_util`) for time/date handling

-   Do not wrap built-in functions (e.g., don’t wrap `dt_util.parse_datetime`)
-   Avoid third-party or custom libraries unless absolutely necessary
-   Never assume static local file paths — use config options and relative paths

## LLM Interaction Guidelines

1. DO NOT create any new files via command line
2. DO NOT use commands like "cat", "echo", or redirects to create files 
3. ALWAYS work with existing files in the blueprint structure first. Create new files only if explicitly requested or required by the integration to follow Home Assistant or HACS standards.
4. When you notice formatting inconsistencies, let me know before continuing

## Coding Style Policy

-   Follow **PEP8**, enforced by **Black**, **isort**, and **Ruff**
-   Use **type hints** on all function and method signatures
-   Add **docstrings** for all public classes and methods
-   Use **f-strings** for string formatting
-   Do not use `print()` — use `_LOGGER` for logging
-   YAML examples must be **valid**, **minimal**, and **Home Assistant compliant**
-   Use 4 spaces for indentation consistently
-   Don't worry about blank lines between methods - follow the existing pattern
-   For GraphQL queries, use triple quotes (""") and preserve them exactly as provided

## Code Structure and Ordering Policy

Use the following order inside Python modules:

1. **Imports**

    - Python standard library imports first
    - Third-party imports (e.g., `homeassistant.*`)
    - Local imports within this component (`from . import xyz`)
    - Enforced automatically by `isort`

2. **Module-level constants and globals**

    - Define constants and globals at module-level (e.g., `DOMAIN`, `_LOGGER`, `CONF_*`, `DEFAULT_*`)

3. **Top-level functions**

    - Use only for stateless, reusable logic
    - Prefix with `_` if internal only (e.g., `_parse_price()`)
    - Do not place Home Assistant lifecycle logic here
    - **Sort and group top-level functions for maximum readability:**
        - Place public API/entry point functions (e.g., service handlers, async setup) at the top of the function section.
        - Direct helpers (called by entry points) immediately after, in the order they are called.
        - Pure/stateless utility functions that are not tightly coupled to entry points at the end.
        - Where possible, order functions so that a function appears before any function that calls it (call hierarchy order).
        - Group related functions by logical purpose or data handled, and use `#region`/`#endregion` folding comments for large files if needed.

4. **Main classes**

    - Define main classes (Home Assistant Entity classes, DataUpdateCoordinators, and ConfigFlow handlers)
    - Order inside class:
        - Special methods (`__init__`, `__repr__`)
        - Public methods (no `_`)
        - Private methods (`_prefix`)
    - All I/O or lifecycle methods must be `async def`

5. **Helper classes**

    - If helper classes become complex, move them to separate modules (e.g., `helpers.py`, `models.py`)

> ✅ Copilot tip:
>
> -   Use top-level functions for pure helpers only.
> -   Prefer structured classes where Home Assistant expects them.
> -   Sort and group functions for maximum readability and maintainability, following call flow from entry points to helpers to utilities.

## Code Comments Policy

-   Do **not** add comments in the code to explain automated changes, such as reordering, renaming, or compliance with coding standards or prompts.
-   Comments in code should be reserved **only** for documenting the actual logic, purpose, or usage of code elements (e.g., classes, methods, functions, or complex logic blocks).
-   If any explanations of automated actions are needed, provide them **outside the code file** (such as in your chat response, PR description, or commit message), not within the Python files themselves.
-   Do **not** insert comments like `# moved function`, `# renamed`, `# for compliance`, or similar into code files.

## Backwards Compatibility Policy

-   Do **not** implement or suggest backward compatibility features, workarounds, deprecated function support, or compatibility layers unless **explicitly requested** in the prompt or project documentation.
-   All code should assume a clean, modern codebase and should target the latest stable Home Assistant version only, unless otherwise specified.
-   If you believe backward compatibility might be required, **ask for clarification first** before adding any related code.

## Translations Policy

-   All user-facing strings supported by Home Assistant's translation system **must** be defined in `/translations/en.json` and (if present) in other `/translations/*.json` language files.
-   When adding or updating a translation key in `/translations/en.json`, **ensure that all other language files in `/translations/` are updated to match the same set of keys**. Non-English files may use placeholder values if no translation is available, but **must** not miss any keys present in `en.json`.
-   Do **not** remove or rename translation keys without updating all language files accordingly.
-   Never duplicate translation keys between `/translations/` and `/custom_translations/`.
-   The `/custom_translations/` directory contains **supplemental translation files** for UI strings or other content not handled by the standard Home Assistant translation format.
    -   Only add strings to `/custom_translations/` if they are not supported by the standard Home Assistant translation system.
    -   Do **not** duplicate any string or translation key that could be handled in `/translations/`.
-   When both exist, the standard Home Assistant translation in `/translations/` **always takes priority** over any supplemental entry in `/custom_translations/`.
-   All translation files (both standard and custom) **must remain in sync** with the English base file (`en.json`) in their respective directory.

> ✅ Copilot tip: Whenever adding or changing user-facing strings, update both the main translation files in `/translations/` and the supplemental files in `/custom_translations/`, keeping them in sync and avoiding duplication.

## Data Structures

Use `@dataclass` for plain data containers where appropriate:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class PriceSlot:
    start: datetime
    end: datetime
    price: float
```

## Visual File Layout

Split component logic into multiple Python modules for improved clarity and maintainability:

```
/custom_components/your_component/
├── __init__.py
├── manifest.json
├── const.py
├── sensor.py
├── config_flow.py
├── models.py       # dataclasses
├── helpers.py      # pure utility functions
```

Use `#region` / `#endregion` optionally to improve readability in large files.

## Optional Files (Custom Integration via HACS)

Only create these files if explicitly required by your integration features. Not all files used in Core integrations apply to Custom Integrations:

-   `services.yaml` – Define custom Home Assistant services
-   `translations/*.json` (e.g., `en.json`, `de.json`) – Provide translations for UI elements
-   Additional platform files (e.g., `binary_sensor.py`, `switch.py`, `number.py`, `button.py`, `select.py`) – Support for additional entity types
-   `websocket_api.py` – Define custom WebSocket API endpoints
-   `diagnostics.py` – Provide diagnostic data to users and maintainers
-   `repair.py` – Offer built-in repair hints or troubleshooting guidance
-   `issue_registry.py` – Communicate integration-specific issues or important changes to users clearly

> ⚠️ **Copilot tip**: Avoid Core-only files (`device_action.py`, `device_trigger.py`, `device_condition.py`, `strings.json`) for Custom Integrations. These are typically not supported or rarely used.

## Linting and Code Quality Policy

-   Enforced by **Ruff**, which runs:

    -   Locally via VS Code devcontainer
    -   Remotely via GitHub Actions

Key Ruff linter rules that must be followed:

-   `F401`, `F841` – No unused imports or variables
-   `E402`, `E501` – Imports at top, lines ≤88 chars
-   `C901`, `PLR0912`, `PLR0915` – Functions must be small and simple
-   `PLR0911`, `RET504` – No redundant `else` after `return`
-   `B008` – No mutable default arguments
-   `T201` – Do not use `print()`
-   `SIM102` – Prefer `if x` over `if x == True`

Also:

-   Use **Black** for formatting
-   Use **isort** for import sorting
-   See `.ruff.toml` for custom settings
-   Prefer **one return statement per function** unless early returns improve clarity

## Tests

This integration does **not include automated tests** by default.

> ⚠️ If Copilot generates tests, keep them minimal and **do not introduce new test frameworks** not already present.
